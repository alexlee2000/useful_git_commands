# 8. Resolving Merge Conflicts
1. In the case that there is a merge conflict, you can abort the merge process if you don't want to fix the conflict right now. 
```
git merge --abort
```

2. Or, you can fix the conflict and contiune the merge by modifying the conflicted files directly. Remove the conflict markers and make adjustments where necessary.
